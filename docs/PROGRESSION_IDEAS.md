## Progression and Difficulty Ideas

- Speed and track complexity
  - Gradually increase forward speed caps and FOV slightly at high speeds.
  - Vary tube radius over distance (narrow segments, brief squeezes).
  - Add sharper curvature bursts or quick S-bends.

- Obstacle density and behavior
  - Increase spawn rate of spheres; make some move (oscillate along normal/binormal).
  - Introduce patterns (walls, rings, grids) that require specific lateral paths.
  - Add “gates” that only open if you’re centered or moving at a target speed.

- Risk/reward and scoring
  - Near-miss bonus: score multiplier for passing close to spheres without contact.
  - Streaks/combos on consecutive box collections; decays on hit.
  - Timed pickups that reward precision and timing.

- Power-ups and temporary states
  - Shield (ignore next collision), slow-mo (briefly reduce time scale), magnet (pull boxes), x2 multiplier.
  - “Purge” pulse that clears spheres right ahead with a cooldown.

- Dynamic environment
  - Cloud density pulses, color themes per “biome”; brief zero-visibility fog bursts.
  - Lateral wind (add force into your spring model) to push you off-center occasionally.
  - Light flicker zones that alter cloud tint and silhouette readability.

- Enemy and hazard variants
  - Homing orb that slowly tracks your lateral offset (telegraphed).
  - Rotating bars/rings aligned to the tube; timing challenges.

- Structure and pacing
  - Waves/levels with short goal text (e.g., “Collect 15 without a hit”), checkpoints.
  - Boss tunnel segments: shrinking radius + moving gate patterns + speed cap lift.
  - Occasional safe zones to breathe and show progress.

- Adaptive difficulty
  - Track recent performance (hits, streaks, variance in lateral control) and scale spawn rate/speed in small steps.
  - Rubber-band difficulty back down after repeated failures.

- Audio/visual feedback
  - Speed-based audio layers; heartbeat or whoosh ramps near misses.
  - Subtle chromatic aberration/vignette at high speed; color grading per biome.

- Persistence and meta goals
  - Daily/weekly challenges (specific seed, constraints).
  - Achievements (streaks, perfect wave, no-hit zone).
  - Online high scores per seed.
